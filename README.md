# Horiseon Refractory Website

## Description

This website is designed wwith accessibility in mind. Focus was to create an easily navigated site for users, including alt attributes for images, working links that direct the user to the specified area of the webpage, and use of semantic HTML to increase SEO. 

An emphasis was placed on using an HTML document that is well organized and logical in structure. The CSS stylesheet was prioritized in a way to minimize redundancy and be easily understood by other developers.

While adjusting this website, I learned the importance of developing in a way that is more easily understood by the user and by others.

## Usage

Once viewing the website, you can open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). You can view different semantic elements of HTML. The CSS stylesheet is organized to be efficient and easy to read, including comments regarding how each selector interacts with HTML.
